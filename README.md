# ADM-HW1
In my repository there is **scripts.py** where I have written the title and the code for each exercise. I have grouped done exercises by Hackerrank' subdomains like 'Introduction', 'Data types' and so on. 
I have not been good enough to complete all the exercises because in my educational path I did not use to programmed. But I have struggled a lot and to help myself sometimes I have also used the chat on Slack and read the Hackerrank's discussion.

Then I have produced a PDF printout, **Screen Hackerrank.pdf** , where there are all my submission in Hackerrank sorted by date: some of them are failed submission but sometimes I have failed the exercise before succeeding.
